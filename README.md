## Usage

### Preparing Data from a Table:
Replace the placeholders in the project with your data from the table. This may include coordinates, object descriptions, and other information required for display on the map.

### Adapting the Model to Your Requirements:
Customize the project model to suit your needs and requirements. This can involve altering the map's appearance, adding extra functionalities, or modifying the application's logic.
